# Locomotion-and-Gait-Analysis-project
The aims of this project are to design and develop a reliable, accurate, and portable system that can monitor the foot plantar pressure and gait of individuals with DFD or any other neurological abnormality in the gait. 

## Description: 
This locomotion and gait analysis course project aims to design and develop a wireless,portable, and wearable system that utilizes inertial measurement units (IMU) at shank and force sensitive
resistor (FSR) at heel, first and fifth metatarsal, and mid-foot in foot plantar to monitor the foot plantar pressure and gait of individuals with diabetic foot disease (DFD) or any other neurological abnormality in the gait. The system will provide visual color coding of foot pressure in addition to some spatiotemporal gait parameters, gait events, phases, shank kinematics, acceleration, angular velocity, estimate center of pressure (CoP), and also is capable of checking patient stability based on FSR and IMU. This system will transfer the data to a PC for visualization, analysis, and data reporting, and it will be developed
professionally regarding wiring, communications, software, user interface. The system will be tested on healthy subjects and patients/simulated patients.

## Project Steps:
1. Research and familiarize with IMU and FSR technology and their application in gait
analysis and foot plantar pressure monitoring.
2. Design the system hardware, selecting appropriate sensors and their numbers, and
creating a compact and portable design. In addition to calibrate the FSR sensors to find
the relation between the pressure/force and its output signals.
3. Develop the firmware for the system, including the algorithms for data processing and
analysis.
4. Develop the software for the system user interface and data visualization.
5. Test the system's accuracy and reliability on healthy subjects, comparing the results to
those obtained through traditional gait analysis methods. Use KINOVEA to study gait
phases.
6. Optimize the system's performance, addressing any issues that arise during testing.
7. Conduct a comparison of using the device on bare foot and shoes used by the device
user to see the damping effect of the shoes.
8. Conduct a test to evaluate the system's efficacy in identifying abnormal foot pressure
and instability in individuals with DFD or other neurological abnormalities in the gait and
compare it with gait lab if possible.
9. Analyze the results of the clinical trial and make any necessary adjustments to the
system's design and functionality.
10. Submit a technical report and video.
By completing these steps, the undergraduate locomotion and gait analysis course project will produce a reliable and accurate system for monitoring the foot plantar pressure and gait of individuals with DFD or any other neurological abnormality in the gait. The system's portability, wireless capability, and ease of use will make it accessible to patients, and its accuracy and reliability will help clinicians identify areas ofabnormal pressure and instability accurately
